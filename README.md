## Research Experience

**APPLIED CNN MODEL ON NON-INVASIVE GLUCOSE PREDICTION**<br>*System Integration and Silicon Implementation Group, NCTU*
-	Maintained embedded system on wearable devices to control the biosensor, the monitor, and Bluetooth.
-	Developed algorithms to preprocess data into the dataset and trained the CNN model.

## Course Project

**CUSTOMIZED ISA PROCESSOR**<br>*Integrated Circuit Design Laboratory*
-	Designed a two-core CPU with the AXI DRAM controller.
-	Designed LRU Cache in the memory controller and boosted the system’s throughput by 50%.
-	Integrated design through IC Design flow in the industry and passed the post-layout simulation.
